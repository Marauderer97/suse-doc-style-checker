Style checker for SUSE documentation
====================================

Tries as hard as its little mind can to check whether documentation is compliant with the
[SUSE Documentation Style Guide](https://github.com/SUSE/doc-styleguide). 

Releases are usually aligned with releases of the Style Guide.
