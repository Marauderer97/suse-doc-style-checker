        This is supposed to be a very long (and thus very hard to read in one go) sentence,
        with the intention of tripping the sentencelength check, which is written in XSLT,
        a language that looks more like torture than an actual language,
        where even very long sentences (such as this one) are relatively easy to
        follow and do not require looking everywhere to be able to guess what an
        XSLT file does.
